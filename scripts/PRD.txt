## Database Schema

CREATE TABLE categories (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  color TEXT DEFAULT '#888888',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  is_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  due_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  priority TEXT CHECK (priority IN ('low', 'medium', 'high')),
  category_id UUID REFERENCES categories(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  position INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.updated_at = NOW();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_tasks_updated_at
BEFORE UPDATE ON tasks
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at();

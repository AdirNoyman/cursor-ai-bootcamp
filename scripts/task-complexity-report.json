    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Set up NextJS project with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the NextJS project setup with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui into specific implementation steps, including project initialization, configuration files, folder structure creation, theme setup, and initial component testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies (NextJS, Tailwind, shadcn/ui) but follows standard setup procedures. The complexity is moderate as it requires following documentation for multiple frameworks and establishing project architecture."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Configure Supabase and implement database schema",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the specific steps for Supabase setup and database schema implementation, including project creation, table definitions with proper relationships, migration setup, client configuration in NextJS, and testing database connections.",
      "reasoning": "Database schema design and implementation requires careful planning. This task involves setting up Supabase, creating tables with proper relationships, configuring migrations, and ensuring proper connectivity, making it moderately complex."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement task CRUD operations with Supabase Edge Functions",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of task CRUD operations into specific Edge Functions, including request validation, database operations, error handling, response formatting, frontend service integration, and comprehensive testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing multiple API endpoints with proper error handling, validation, and database operations. The complexity comes from ensuring all task fields are properly handled and creating a robust API layer."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement category CRUD operations with Supabase Edge Functions",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for implementing category CRUD operations, including Edge Function creation for each operation, handling category-task relationships, implementing color selection, creating frontend services, and testing all endpoints.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to task 3 but slightly less complex. The main challenge is handling the relationship between categories and tasks, especially during deletion operations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Create task management UI components",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task management UI implementation into specific components: TaskList, TaskItem, TaskForm with validation, DeleteTaskDialog, responsive layout design, priority/status indicators, and integration with the backend services.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating multiple UI components with complex interactions. Form validation, responsive design, and visual indicators add to the complexity. Integration with the backend services requires careful state management."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Create category management UI components",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation steps for category management UI components, including CategoryList, CategoryItem, CategoryForm with color picker, DeleteCategoryDialog, and integration with task components.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to task 5 but with fewer components and simpler interactions. The color picker adds some complexity, but overall this is less complex than the task management UI."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement task filtering, sorting, and search functionality",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of filtering, sorting, and search into specific components: backend API parameter handling, filter UI controls, sort UI controls, search input implementation, dynamic UI updates, and state management for filter conditions.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires both frontend and backend changes. The complexity comes from handling multiple filter conditions, sorting options, and search parameters while ensuring the UI updates dynamically."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement drag-and-drop task reordering",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for implementing drag-and-drop reordering: selecting and setting up a DnD library, creating the reorder API endpoint, handling position updates in the database, implementing visual feedback during drag operations, optimizing database operations, and testing across devices.",
      "reasoning": "Drag-and-drop functionality is inherently complex, requiring state management, UI feedback, and database updates. Optimizing the reordering to minimize database operations adds additional complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the accessibility implementation into: keyboard shortcut system, ARIA attribute addition, keyboard navigation testing, screen reader compatibility, focus management for dialogs, and help documentation creation.",
      "reasoning": "Accessibility requires attention to detail across the entire application. Implementing keyboard shortcuts, proper ARIA attributes, and focus management while ensuring screen reader compatibility makes this a moderately complex task."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Optimize performance and implement final UI polish",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the performance optimization and UI polish steps: implementing loading states, adding error handling, optimizing database queries, setting up client-side caching, adding animations, conducting performance testing against metrics, and performing final UI review.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves optimizing the entire application across multiple dimensions. Performance optimization, error handling, animations, and ensuring the application meets specific performance metrics make this the most complex task in the project."
